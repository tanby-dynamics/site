Tanby Dynamics offers services including:

- hardware design
- embedded systems design
- application integrations, such as management consoles, streaming data into data warehouses, and mobile and rich client applications

We are able to lead teams in system and integration design, from hardware at a modular level up to integration with systems running on AWS or Azure for example.

Each project is unique, so we can tailor our quotes to suit the expected outcomes, on an daily time-plus-materials basis. We can also use our resources to find additional people, ranging from electrical engineers to mobile application developers to integration software developers.

### Joint ventures and profit sharing
We are happy to discuss joint ventures and partial work-for-shares arrangements. Note that we will require a full prospectus in order to evaluate our involvement.

[Rebecca](https://becdetat/about-me) is also happy to join company boards, either as a part-owner or in a consultative role. She brings over 20 years of commercial experience as a software developer, a systems integrator, and in the last six or so years as leader and CTO, along with designing complex software system architectures.
