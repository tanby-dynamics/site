### Rebecca Scott
Tanby Dynamics' principal is [Rebecca Scott](https://becdetat.com/about-me), a software developer with over 20 years of commercial experience.

Rebecca has experience in building and designing systems in the .NET stack, Ruby, and PHP. She also has some experience in developing embedded systems using C, C++, and Python.

She has led the development of several commercial projects involving hardware design and integration, including:

- a system that allows BLE tokens to be used as triggers in mobile applications, using a rich rules-based engine to take different logic-based actions when the BLE token come in and out of range
- Particle-based relays and sensors that perform actions and log data based on inputs including temperature and humidity, as well as schedule-based operations to adjust sprinklers, temperature control systems, and hydroponics systems

She is capable of developing both embedded and integration systems, and has some basic experience in hardware design as well.


## Tanby Dynamics
Tanby Dynamics is based in Tanby, a small area outside of Yeppoon, Queensland Australia.

We offer services including:

- hardware design
- embedded systems design
- application integrations, such as management consoles, streaming data into data warehouses, and mobile and rich client applications

While we don't have a lot of in-house hardware design capacity, as this is something Rebecca is up-skilling on at the moment, we do have access to several electrical engineers, and have enough electrical engineering experience to be able to lead those projects.

Similarly we have access to mobile and web developers, and can quickly scale up out resources to include more people in larger scale projects.

Please <a href="mailto:me@becdetat.com">contact Rebecca</a> to confidentially discuss your project. Joint ventures are welcome for discussion.
